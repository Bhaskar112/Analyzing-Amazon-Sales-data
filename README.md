# Analyzing Amazon Sales data
## Problem Statement:

<p>Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise. I have extracted the Amazon sales dataset, transform them using data cleaning and data preprocessing and then finally loading it for analysis. We need to visualize sales trend  month-wise, year-wise and yearly_month-wise. </p>

<p>The main goal of the project is to find key metrics and factors and then show meaningful relationships between them based on different features available in the dataset.</p>
<pre> 
<li> Data Collection      : Imported data from dataset given in the project using Pandas library. </li>
<li> Data Cleaning        : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights. </li>
<li> Data Preprocessing   : Modified the structure of data in order to make it more understandable and suitable and convenient for statistical analysis. </li>
<li> Data Analysis        : I started analyzing dataset using Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib and Seaborn. </li>
<li> Data Visualization   : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables. Also used Tableau for data visulization. </li>
